In February 2025, Helen and I spent a week in Nozawa Onsen (野沢温泉村) (Sometimes written as Nozawaonsen) and enjoyed the town and slopes. Here is a collection of some useful information about the town and our stay that hopefully people can find useful.

## Travel

Getting to Nozawaonsen is easy. Take a Shinkansen (bullet train) to Iiyama and then take a bus to Nozawaonsen from the Iiyama train terminal. There are a couple bus stops in Nozawaonsen, so just get off at the stop closest to your accomodation!

For the shinkansen, you can either book a day or two in advance and get good seats, or book at the station on the day, and you might have to wait a train of two to find one with spare seats. Once at Iiyama, follow the extremly obvious signage to the bus stop just outside the station, and wait for the Nozawa Onsen Liner! [You can find the timetable here](https://nozawaonsen.info/en/nozawa-onsen-liner/), but it comes ~hourly while the sun is up. Buy tickets at the ticket machine outside. It's ¥600 per adult at the time of writing.

Tavelling here is really easy, and not worth stressing about. No advanced booking is required and a spur-of-the-moment day-trip would be easy to pull off. On the other hand, something you will have to book in advance is your...

## Accomodation

There are a limited number of hotels in Nozawa Onsen, and if you come in on-peak snow season to enjoy the consistent Japanese snow, you'll be competing lots of tourists (and what seems like the entire population of Australia) to book the best spots.

We booked 4 months in advance, and most accomodation had already booked out. The cheapest accomodation by far was the "Berg Marukeneya", which is where we booked. It's a small, 2 star hotel. I think it was free and inexpensive because it's, on the far side of town, doesn't have individual bathrooms (only shared), and has little to no online presence. This is enough to spook a classic western tourist, but spured on by the promise of good value, we booked it.

The hotel was incredible, and I'm half tempted to not write any more about it so nobody else figures out how good of a deal it is. Let me address some of its best features:

### But it's so far away from town!

Sure, it's a good 15 minute walk to the center of the town, but if you're booking yourself a ski holiday, you're probably physically fit enough that a 15 minute walk doesn't scare you that much. There are also plenty of food options closer than the centre of town, so you won't have to walk too far to get to them.

Additionally, the ski resort area can be accessed from multiple locations. If you're staying in town, you'll have fairly easy access to the Hikage or Nagasaka area gondolas. You'll probably have to walk a short distance up a steap hill before you get to these. These feel like the "main" ski areas with the most popular gondolas, big green slopes for learning, and the main ski resort building for ski lessons. 

If you stay on the south side of town (where Berg Marukeneya is), you have access to the Karasawa slope and it's lift. You can take that, and then do a nice traverse to the main area! The walk from Berg Marukenya to the slope was actually about 50m uphill, and a lot faster than most of the hotels in town.

### It doesn't have bathrooms!

Booking.com says: "All rooms are fitted with a shared bathroom", which isn't really that explanatory and probably scares people away. All rooms have their own toilets. If you want to shower, the hotel has a large shared bathroom downstairs where you can clean up after a long day on the slopes. There are about 4 seperate shower stations where you clean yourself before getting in a big hot bath to relax. It's very Japanese, so you have to get naked with the homies. If that scares you, fair enough, but in Nozawa __Onsen__ the public baths (Onsens) are kinda one of the main draws of the town, no? So you should embrace it!

### Breakfast

I obviously am not privy to the entire management structure of the Hotel, but it *feels* like a small family owned hotel. Breakfast starts at 7:30am, and was different every morning. When you walk in, you'll find your plate already served up at the table with a variety of tasty Japanese goodies, so don't be late or it'll get cold. Here are some pictures of our breakfasts!

The chair lifts start at 8:30am, so a 7:30am breakfast is perfect timing. Berg Marukeneya also lets you book dinner here, but you have to book in the morning, and at ¥3800/person that's a lot steaper than getting something in town for ~¥1500 or less.

In conclusion, I highly recommend staying at the Berg Marukeneya. It was excellent accomodation at a reasonable price.

### Other

There are a number of other cool things the hotel has:

* Excellent and easily accessable ski room.
* Big traditional room with tatami mat floors and futons for sleeping.
* Nearest public onsen is <50m away.
* Can buy ski lift pass from the front desk.
* Nearest ski rental is across the road.
* Nice view.
* In-room hanging space for wet clothes.

### Critiques

The Berg Marukeneya doesn't have humidifiers. I don't know why, but no ski resort I've stayed at in Japan has provided humidifiers. Almost all hotels in the city provide them, but in the snow, a colder and less humid environ, they're never provided? Consequently I spent the first hour of each day attempting to rehydrate my poor withered sinuses. If you're making a weekend trip from Tokyo and own a humidifer, or have bountify luggage space, I'd recommend bringing one. Maybe my nose has just acclimitized to Brisbane's swampy weather though, and this isn't a problem for everyone.

## Onsens

One of the main draws to Nozawa Onsen are, well, the Onsens. On the south side of town, there was only really [one that was a short walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fS4Vy8Zh81YKrBgB9), but in the centre of town there are loads. If you really want to sample all the onsens, I'd recommend staying further in town.

Before you go, brush up on your onsen etiquette first. But here are some additional tips for specifically these onsens from an uncultured Australian who didn't know what he was doing:

* You have to clean yourself before you use the onsen. If you want to do a good job of that, you'll have to bring your own soap/shampoo to the cleaning station.
* The cleaning stations have a single tap which ejects absulutely _freezing_ mountain water. Unless you _want_ to clean yourself with 0 degree water, you're supposed to get a bucket and scoop scalding water from the onsen, and then add cold water if you want something more tepid, and use that for washing.

As an Australian who swam a lot growing up, we'd all bring flip-flops to the pool so your feet wouldn't touch the ground in the showers, because it always felt gross and unclean. The onsens here are cleaned regularly and everyone sits their bare ass on the ground and it's normal.

Also, you might go home smelling slightly like eggs. That's just part of the fun.

## Skiing and the Mountain

### Downhill Skiing

The Nozawa ski resort was excellent. There are long easy green runs and tough ungroomed blacks. It's a big mountain, and it took probably 4 days before I'd skiied the whole mountain. I'm no expert skier, but my take on this mountain vs others I've been to are:

* If you're hardcore and planning a long ski trip (longer than a week) maybe consider Hakuba or some other park where you can bus between different mountains that are part of the same resort.
* If you're big into hitting the park and love your jumps, maybe come later in the season, or consider going somewhere else. It snowed all 6 days we were here which was incredible, but the jumps and small park isn't maintained while it's dumping, and the single park is serviced by quite a slow chairlift.

Luckily I don't like the park because I enjoy my bones un-fractured, and I'm easily entertained skiing the same run over and over, so I had a blast.

#### Lessons

If you want to book some lessons, you can do it [here](https://en.nozawaski.com/the-mountain/lesson/ski-school/), but if you'd rather pay for these things in person and not on a website of dubious reliability you can go to the main building at the base of Hikage station and book it at the counter.
