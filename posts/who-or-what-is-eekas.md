I currently live in Southbank, Brisbane. It's an inner-city suburb, and while walking around, I see a lot of grafitti. If you see the same word enough, eventually you start to recognise it, and I'm really seeing a lot of "Eekas". Here are some tags I've seen myself:

Cordelia Street

Manning Street

Misc other tags:

Upon Googling "Eekas", I find information for a hair salon, and a bunch of photos/videos on Brisbane street-art focussed Instagram photographers. It's some of the more impressive graffiti I've seen. Here are some examples I've ripped from Instagram so people without Meta accounts can view them:

Some trains

Some nice walls

Also their graffiti is prolific enough, that it was [captured by another artist](https://sidegallery.com.au/exhibitions/roadside-paintings#&gid=1&pid=15) in the painting shown below:

![A painting of a van, side-on. The side has been graffitied with "Eekas".](/images/blog/who-or-what-is-eekas/eekas_painting.jpg)

I trawled the depths of Google to find more mentions of Eekas, and the only significant mention I could find was [this Instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/toolsofthetrade_official/reel/CsuxBISBfVu/) showing how to pressurise a fire extinguisher and use it to spray paint. The voice has been changed and the person has been blurred to maintain anonymity, which makes sense given the nature of the video, but that's about as far as I got.

Mr Eekas, if you're out there, hit me up.

**Update 12/07/25:**

Here are some more tags I've seen while walking around the last week. Seeing Eekas tags are like little Brisbane [Hidden Mickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Mickey)s to me at this point. Secret urban easter-eggs to look out for.

I think I might have found the van in the painting. I believe this was on Mollison Street.

Eekas Bin.

Holographic Eekas stickers on Melbourne Street.

The skate park at Davies Park. (Not seen: 4 more Eekas's just to the left of this one.)

Side of a building as viewed from Riverside Drive. How'd he get up there?

Looking forward to finding them all!
