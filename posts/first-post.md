I have been having lots of fun learning about Next.js recently. The first tutorial I encountered was from the team behind Next.js, and it runs the beginner through the creation of a basic blogging website, highlighting the features and design choices of the framework along the way.

Since I've also been spending a lot of time on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) recently, and it seems like everyone and their dog has a blog (with far too much care, thought, and discussion having gone into the specific tech stack used to serve said blog) that I figured I'd host this too. I intend to fairly infrequently write about tech things I've been working on, and problems I run into so that if someone stumbles into one of my posts from Google, maybe it saves them a little bit of time.
