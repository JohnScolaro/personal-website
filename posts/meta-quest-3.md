Recently I had my birthday and my girlfriend thoroughly surprised me with a Meta Quest 3. The heatset sits almost perfectly in the 'present space' because it's an item I'd never buy myself, but if I had one, I'd genuinely get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

I've been using it a lot over the last while and I wanted to write down some of the thoughts that I've had since I set it all up. I'm going to just write everything down that I think of and probably re-arrange it into an actual blog post sometime soon.

2. My Setup and how I got the optimal experience out of my quest.
3. The ecosystem in general.
   - Meta Quest store vs Steam?
4. The VR space moving into the future.
   - Mention obvious improvements over the past.
   - Start off with where I currently think we are.
   - So easy to see where this is going.
     - Gaming
     - Productivity
       - Will I use it for productivity IRL? Fuck no, not yet.
   - So easy to see all the "easy wins" and possible improvements.
5. Comments on gaming.
   - Always more effort.
   - Always more immersive?
   - Niches that it does well in:
     - Simulation games
       - Car racing
       - Truck simulator
     - Games that induce adrenaline
     - Games that entertain intrusive thoughts
     - Game ideas that we could see in the future?
       - Superhero games
       - Extreme sports?
     - Integration with AI?
6. Niche things I want
   - Height limits on chaperone.
   - Better interfaces.
     - Keyboards suck. Actually, just touching flat surfaces in general sucks.
7. Summary
   - Respect for the industry in general
     - Comparison to crypto
