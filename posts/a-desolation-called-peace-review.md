"A Desolation Called Peace" is the second book by AnnaLinden Weller under the pen name [Arkady Martine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Martine) that won the [Hugo Award for Best Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel) in 2022.

Seems to be getting forced into situations by the councillors from lsel. Also just is homies with the FUCKING EMPEROR. Just be like "haha no" to heritage and do what you want? Texcalaan is far bigger and more important than lsel.

Jesus what is this contrived argument with 3 seagrass? They literally just reunited after months apart. They kissed. This is 1 star trash romance writing. Jesus Christ. THE FUCKING SILENT TREATMENT? THIS IS CRINGE WORTHY COMMUNICATION. "I want her to notice she's hurting me" can Yskandr be like "OMG shut the fuck up?" The next 100 pages of constant "I seriously hope I haven't fucked everything up" 🥺

How does 9 hibiscus not have a visual on the ground team? That makes no sense no? Why isn't everything happening on the ground being recorded and shown on the ship? Did they seriously not record it or the 20 words? They just remembered?

This first contact vs Rocky in the last book. Fuck me. It's like two useless political beurocrats meeting aliens instead of an engineer.

20 cicada, swarm, just so graphically described.

Holy fucking shit that twist

The army is getting SUPER antsy after talking to them twice?

The WHOLE TIME YOU COULD HAVE JUST HAD RADIO CONTACT WITH THE NEGOTIATORS?!?!?! WTF

End of the book was sorta a let-down. Swarm magically negotiates a ceasefire, and moonrise's ship's bridge gets destroyed. Shit wrapping up of "mahit and 3 seagrass"s relationship, and what their future plans are. Book abruptly ends.
