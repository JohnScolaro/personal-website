"A Desolation Called Peace" is the second book by AnnaLinden Weller under the pen name [Arkady Martine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Martine) that won the [Hugo Award for Best Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel) in 2022. Since this book beat "Project Hail Mary" for the Huge award, I wanted to read it and see if I think it deserved the win. TL;DR: I think it did, but only just, and I thought it was _slightly_ worse than the first book. Here were my thoughts:

## Summary

The story of this book follows the adventures of three chacters simultaneously:

- Mahit on Lsel, taking a breather after the end of the last novel.
- Eight Antidot, sneaking around the capital.
- Nine Hibiscus, the fleet captain of the six flagships at the front of a war againt strange ringed alien ships.

It begins with Mahit realising that the counsillors on Lsel don't really like her, and is saved from having her imago inspected as Three Seagrass shows up to take her to "The Weight of the Wheel", (Nine Hibiscus's ship) in an attempt to communicate with these strange ships.

Once again, they navigate a sticky political web with more of a war-time flavour in an attempt to de-escalate fighting along the front, and come to understand these new aliens.

## Things I Didn't Like

### Mahit and Three Seagrass Fight 😠💔

In "A Memory of Empire" we read about the blossoming friendship of Mahit and Three Seagrass, which finished with a kiss (🌹💃 **#romantic** 💋😏) as the emperor prepared to ritually sacrifice himself (💅😤 **#dramatic** ✨💔 ). In "A Desolation Called Peace", after three weeks apart, Three Seagrass appears on Lsel station to conveniently extridite Mahit from the political situation on Lsel with a new high-stakes mission on the edge of space. Readers are treated to the most contrived, reality-TV quality, nonsense schoolgirl argument, as Mahit and Three Seagrass escalate literally nothing into a possibly friendship destroying argument for _no good reason_. If I wanted to read this dramatic nonsensense I'd go read my Facebook messages from 2010.

Very cringe.

Mahit and Mrs Seagrass are professional diplomats. Two professionals trained to maintain composure and negotiate in stressful situations. This argument feels _out of character, \_synthetic_, _forced_.

We receive excellent fight flashbacks for the next 100+ pages with lines like:

> 🥀😩 I want her to see how she hurts me 😢🥺

I especially think it's funny that Mahit has a 30 and a 50 year old man in her mind though all of this. I'm surprised the Yskander's don't roll Mahit's eyes so far back into her head they fall out her mouth and scream: "Oh my god, stop being a child!"

### The Ending Is Too Short

The ending, the most intense part of this book, was completely anti-climactic. I loved the aliens destroying only the bridge of the _parabolic compression_. That's **totally epic**. But _how_ it was written was like:

> Haha the aliens blew up the bridge, and the ship stopped advancing.

This scene is _the payoff_ for having read the book to this point, and it's utterly underwelming. If we compare it to the dramatic buildup of the emperors speech before sacraficing himself at the end of the previous book, this is just weak.

I would love to have seen it drawn out. Tell us what Sixteen Moonrise saw seconds before she was obliterated. Tell us what she thought. Did she know she'd been betrayed? What was the atmosphere on the bridge? Did she die instantly, or did she know it was coming?

After this, Ninteen Adze has a quick chat to Eight Antidote, Mahit and 3 Seagrass talk about what they're going to do next, and the book just ends. It felt like a let-down.

## Things I Loved

Honestly the above gripes are the only real gripes I have with the whole book. Here are some specific things that I loved:

- The "flavour chapters" from the aliens point of view were very well written, and fun to read.
- The chapter where we learn there is some sort of fungus in the aliens is incredibly cool. It was an especially satisfying way of releasing some knowledge slowly, because the reader obviously knows the alien is a hive-mind already from the cool aforementioned alien chapters.
- The writing was just as vivid as the first book. The descriptions, especially about Twenty Cicada and the damp hydroponics bay were excellent.

## Things that just made no sense at all.

### Lack of Radio Communication with Alien First Contact Team

I was absolutely baffled by the first contact delegation. Two aliens and two people were sent down to the surface of Peloa-2, and:

- None of the first contact was recorded.
- None of the first contact was transmitted back to the ship.

That's like sending man to the moon and just not recording it. Mahit and Three Seagrass had to come back to the ship, and the entire civilisation of Teixcalaan must rely purely on the memory of two individuals to recite what they had learnt about the aliens and the state of their communications.

For starters, this is a massive security breach, because Mahit and Three Seagrass could have just lied. Also wouldn't you want the confrontation to be beamed back to Teixcalaan (or at least the ship) to have hundreds of people attempting to decipher the language?

To drive my point home, here is a snippet from the book:

> Down on Peloa-2, four of her people—plus an Information agent and a barbarian diplomat, but four of her people, first and foremost—were either being dismembered by aliens (worst case) or being subject to heatstroke-inducing temperatures while waiting for negotiations to proceed (best case). And she could do nothing but wait...

Want to know what's going on? JUST RADIO THEM?!?!

Then on a later mission to see the aliens, when Twenty Cicada is talking to them, Nine Hibiscus DOES literally just call him on the radio and talk to him. So we _know_ that they have the technology.

This made no sense to me at all.

## Other Comments

- Surely on Teixcalaan, the shard trick is immediately co-opted to transmit information faster than the speed of light to make money on Teixcalaanli stock exchanges.
- Mahit gets almost bullied by the councillors on Lsel who don't really like her or see her as useful. Are we forgetting from the previous book that she's good friends with the _emperor_ of Texcalaan? Amnardbat threatening unconcentual brain surgeory? Can Mahit not threaten to just have the station taken over? I feel like Mahit has a lot more power than she acts like.

- Over the course of this book, I've come to dislike all the counsilors on Lsel. Lsel persues isolationist policy and lets citzens leave and export goods but nobody from Teixcalaan can enter. Historically this doesn't ever seem like a winning move for the isolationists.[^1] Why do they resist Teixcalaan culture so much? It feels like the entire Lsel government is very conservative/reactionary, and is incredibly scared of change. Strangely they also seem to be more scared of Teixcalaanli culture-creep than impending obliteration by alien fleet. I spent a lot of time wondering if Mahit would have an "Are we the baddies?" moment.

I'm starting to think Lsel are the bad guys.

- I know this isn't accurate at all, but I visualise Twenty Cicada to look something like this, but with green fractal tattoos.

Bald, male, some portion of skin is green, second in charge. That's Twenty Cicada alright.
