[The Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) is a sci-fi classic from way back in 1969. I saw some of Ursula's books [talked about online](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/get-weird-and-disappear/), and referenced as the origin of the word "Ansible" (which was borrowed by the [software](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)>) tool and [Enders Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game)). Also because it took out the [Hugo Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel) in 1970, 4 years after [Dune](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)>). This confluence of reasons delivered me to the idea that I should give it a read.

Ursula wrote a story that still feels unique and fresh 56 years later, exploring an imaginary society on another planet through the eyes of an interstallar envoy. It was an excellent book, and I personally really enjoyed it, however I certainly wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for an easy read. As usual, if you want a bog-standard review, go read someone else's. Over the last 56 years, I'm sure a good couple have been published. This is my critique:

## Vocabulary

I immediately knew this book would be an absolutely brutal read. The Left Hand of Darkness hits you with the one-two punch of:

- Being an old book
- Using an extensive vocabulary

Did people use more words a few generations back? Am I dumb? I guess we'll never know, but I kept a list of some of the words I had to look up. How many of these words do you know? I scored 0:

- Augury
- Disconsolate
- Ignominious
- Impugn
- Limpid
- Obdurate
- Panoply
- Perfidy
- Phlegmatic
- Potentate
- Umbrageous
- Vitperation

On top of these frequent gifts of confusion, Ursula enjoys a the occasional made-up word too, like _shifgrethor_ or _pesthry_.

On the topic of _being old_, it feels like old books tend to use slightly different sentence structure that requires more mental effort to parse than modern books. The most brutal book I've read was probably [Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Seas), which was written ~1870. The Left Hand of Darkness wasn't as bad, but still comes in second. Just an an example, here is a sentance from the book:

> I had a new passport, and a free pass to all transient-houses on my road, and a telegraphed invitation to the Mishnory residence of the first commensal district commissioner of entry-roads and ports, Mr Uth Shusgis.

## The Big Snow Journey

In my mind, the book has roughly 5 sections:

![A vertical timeline of the book. There are 5 sections spanning from page 0 to page 158.](/images/blog/the-left-hand-of-darkness-review/timeline.png)

Of these 5 sections, the one I've called "The Big Walk" was easily the worst. I get it, it's a 80+ day death defying hike with the two main characters where they both almost die and the reader really learns the ins-and-outs of pushing a sled across a glacier. The main characters talk a little, but very little happens. Compared to the other 30-page sections, it was incredibly slow.

## Conclusion

![A flipped variant of the Arthur fist meme, darkened so it looks a left hand in darkness. Get it?](/images/blog/the-left-hand-of-darkness-review/left_hand_of_darkness.png)

It's a left hand and it's in darkness. Get it?

But for real, it's a damn good book, and a more nuanced and personal sci-fi that explores society more than technology. I enjoyed it.
