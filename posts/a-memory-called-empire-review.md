"A Memory Called Empire" won [Hugo Award for Best Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel) in 2020, and if its sequel pipped Project Hail Mary ((which I also thought was fabulous)["https://johnscolaro.xyz/blog/project-hail-mary-review"]) for the title in 2022, I wanted to see what this series has to offer. As usual, the book delivered, and it's probably the best book I read all year. But I don't want to re-spout the numerous praises this book has already received, I want to comment on some of the weird things that made me think: "Huh?"

## Summary

"A Memory Called Empire" starts with our protagonist Mahit Dzmare, arriving on Teixcalaan (the planet-city at the centre of its empire), as the diplomat from her station on the outer reaches of the empire to both: figure out what happened to the previous ambasidor, and to keep the Teixcalaanli Empire from anexing the station. She immediately lands in a complex succession crisis, as the kingdoms most dangerous players are circling around an old, dieing Emperor, all vying to be next in-line for the throne.

## Comments on the Story

### Sleep

I read a lot when I get sick. Reading is one of the lowest energy activities, so it sometimes feels nice to curl up under the sheets with a box of tissues and just read for 8 hours. Don't do that with this book. This book wasn't a relaxing book. Why? Because Mahit never goes to sleep! 80% of the book is either Mahit frantically slamming all-nighters as she packs her schedule full of high-stakes political meetings during the day, and even higher stakes covet-ops during the night. The most rest she gets over the timeframe of the book is when she's undergoing BRAIN SURGERY which as she mentions in the book, DOESN'T EVEN COUNT as sleep! Please just let Mahit go to bed.

On top of never sleeping and being constantly exhausted, Mahit aquires many layers of injury during her week on the jewel of the world. She:

- Gets pinned down in an explosion.
- Gets attacked by an assassin.
- Hand disolved by poisinous sap.
- The aforementioned brain surgery.

And through this, _with zero sleep_, is sprinting around a rioting populace, running from gun-toting beaurocrats, and is somehow supposed to function normally!

Reading this book while sick exhaused **me**. Could we not have sent Mahit home for an early night's sleep just once? Let her have a slow morning, maybe eat some eggs on toast. Slow the pace down for 5 minutes. Let her recover. The pacing could have been significantly relaxed withough sacrificing any of the story.

### Science's Perfect Algorithm

[insert image of ]

Of the different factions vying for power there seem to be:

- The One Lightning + Ten Pearl's epic military/science alliance.
- Thirty Larkspur as the economically popular Ezuazuacat.
- Six Direction + Eight Antidote as an eternal emperor imago line.
- Eight Loop of the Judiciary is doing her own thing.
- Ninteen Adze kinda just vibin'?

Rather than actually dive into any of these storylines, the author just kinda "alludes" to them being there, which gives the reader the general "feeling" that each faction is fighting for their own agenda, but does feel lazy compared to actually telling a story.

For example, we know Thirty Larkspur tells Mahit cryptically: "The deal is off" and attempts to poison her with a flower. What deal was called off? Why did he think killing Mahit was a good idea? Did he talk to Nineteen Adze about the murder? Why does Thirty Larkspur want to be the emperor anyway? What's his plan to beat... the military? Out-beaurocracy them? It's fun to just let it be mysterious, but nothing would beat a single chapter from the point of view of Thirty Larkspur going about his day, and maybe we could get some clarity on his thinking.

The most frustrating instance of this is the entire power-grab attempt from One Lightning and Ten Pearl. For starter, we don't even _know_ that science and military are colluding except there is enough circumstantial evidence to assume (again, we're always assuming) that they are. Natural any curious reader will have questions:

- What does science have to gain from this?
- How does science control the sunlit?
- What's this "AI that controls the city"?
- How is science changing that AI to achieve their goals?

None of these get answered.

There is so much good material here to explain, and it feels like a waste to not explain what's going on!

Felt like dune in this regard

### Terrible Love Story

Terrible love story.

## Comments on the Writing

### Teixcalaan

Surely if you're the author, you make the name of the capital shorter or easier to pronounce. It's ["teyks-kah-lan"](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/243657/pronunciation-of-teixcalaan) and it's confusing. Not just this though, but if something is from Teixcalaan, it's Teixcalaanli, and people from Teixcalaan are Teixalaanlitzlim, which feel ludicrous. Generally in languages, the more important a concept, the shorter the word. If you can think up a real world demonym with five (like "tekys-kah-lan-litz-lim") sylables, I'll be incredibly impressed. Since the Teixcalaan language is often described as a using "glyphs" I assume it's a logographic system like Chinese or something. I wonder if it would almost increase readability to just replace Teixcalaan with 京[^1] or something in the book. Explain how to pronounce it once, and then just use the glyph. Teach the reader Teixcalaanli while reading. Creating a new font for Teixcalaanli glyphs would probably give the typographers of the print edition an anyrysm though.

### Reading Curve

Just read the number of new words in the fucking prelude. Bruh.

### Colour

So colourful. Especially compared to project Hail Mary. \* Absolutely loved the number noun names.

### Anime Monologing

The constant descriptions mid conversion feel like anime internal monologue constantly and are annoying after a while. Very flowery and descriptive though.

### Parallels to Dune

Poems like in bloody dune damn it, but actually good.

## Other

- Flower budget in movie adaptation would be rediculous.
- Endocrine endocrine endocrine, we need a synonym for endocrine
- The numbers in reddits button game are like names.
- Having written a "succession problem" story naturally draws some parallels to the other popular succession story kicking about at the moment, namely: "Succession". Where instead of the the political maneuvering of Connor/Kendal/Roman/Shiv to succeed Logan, you've go
- Yskandr no mention of 15 engine death on wake

[1^]: 京 means capital. Which is why 北京 (Beijing) and 東京 (Tokyo) both have it. It's often mentioned that Teixcalaan is one glyph. Notice that the symbol is ONE sylable in both these words, yet Teixcalaan in 3.
