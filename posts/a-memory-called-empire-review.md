["A Memory Called Empire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_Called_Empire) is a book by AnnaLinden Weller under the pen name [Arkardy Martine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Martine) that won the [Hugo Award for Best Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel) in 2020, and since its sequel pipped [Project Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary) ([which I also thought was fabulous]("https://johnscolaro.xyz/blog/project-hail-mary-review")) for the same award in 2022, I wanted to see what this series has to offer. As usual, the book delivered, and it's one of the best books I've read all year. But I don't want to re-spout the numerous praises this book has already received, I want to comment on some of the weird things that made me think: "Huh?"

## Summary

"A Memory Called Empire" starts with our protagonist Mahit Dzmare, arriving on Teixcalaan (the planet-city at the centre of the inter-stellar Teixcalaan empire), as the diplomat from her distant station to both: figure out what happened to the previous ambasidor, and to keep the Teixcalaanli Empire from anexing the station. She immediately lands in a complex succession crisis, as the kingdoms most dangerous players are circling around an old, dieing Emperor, all vying to be next in-line for the throne.

## Comments on the Story

### Sleep

I read a lot when I get sick. Reading is one of the lowest energy activities, so it sometimes feels nice to curl up under the sheets with a box of tissues and just read for 8 hours. Don't do that with this book. This book wasn't a relaxing book. Why? Because Mahit never goes to sleep! 80% of the book is either Mahit frantically slamming all-nighters as she packs her schedule full of high-stakes political meetings during the day, and even higher stakes covet-ops during the night. The most rest she gets over the timeframe of the book is when she's undergoing BRAIN SURGERY which as she mentions in the book, DOESN'T EVEN COUNT as sleep! Please just let Mahit go to bed.

On top of never sleeping and being constantly exhausted, Mahit aquires many layers of injury during her week on the jewel of the world. She:

- Gets pinned down in an explosion.
- Gets attacked by an assassin.
- Hand disolved by poisinous sap.
- The aforementioned brain surgery.

And through this, _with zero sleep_, is sprinting around a rioting populace, running from gun-toting beaurocrats, and is somehow supposed to function normally!

Reading this book while sick exhaused **me**. Could we not have sent Mahit home for an early night's sleep just once? Let her have a slow morning, maybe eat some eggs on toast? Slow the pace down for 5 minutes. Let her recover. I think the pacing _could_ have been significantly relaxed withough sacrificing any of the story.

### Science's Perfect Algorithm

[insert image of handshake]

Of the different factions vying for power there seem to be:

- The One Lightning + Ten Pearl's epic military/science alliance.
- Thirty Larkspur as the economically popular Ezuazuacat.
- Six Direction + Eight Antidote as an eternal emperor imago line.
- Eight Loop of the Judiciary is doing... something...
- Ninteen Adze kinda just vibin'?

Rather than actually dive into any of these storylines, the author just kinda "alludes" to them being there, which gives the reader the general "feeling" that each faction is fighting for their own agenda, but does feel lazy compared to actually telling a story.

For example, we know Thirty Larkspur tells Mahit cryptically: "The deal is off" and attempts to poison her with a flower. What deal was called off? Why did he think killing Mahit was a good idea? Did he talk to Nineteen Adze about the murder? Why does Thirty Larkspur want to be the emperor anyway? What's his plan to beat... the military? Out-beaurocracy them? It's fun to just let it be mysterious, but nothing would beat a single chapter from the point of view of Thirty Larkspur going about his day, and maybe we could get some clarity on his thinking.

The most frustrating instance of this is the entire power-grab attempt from One Lightning and Ten Pearl. For starter, we don't even _know_ that science and military are colluding except there is enough circumstantial evidence to assume (again, we're always assuming) that they are. Naturally any curious reader will have questions:

- What does science have to gain from this?
- How does science control the sunlit?
- What's this "AI that controls the city"?
- How is science changing that AI to achieve their goals?

None of these get answered!

This is so infuriating, because there is so much good material here to explain! And it feels like a waste to **not** to explain it!

### Mahit and Three Seagrass Kiss

Mahit and Three Seagrass kissing at the end didn't feel right to me. Over the first 80% of the book, the relationship between Three Seagrass goes from reluctant cultural liaison, to good friend. There is never any mention about "finding her attractive" or "seeing her in a new light" and then bam they're kissing. I didn't really feel it.

## Comments on the Writing

### Teixcalaan

In languages, more commonly used words tend to be shorter. This is called the ["Brevity Law" or "Zipf's Law of Abbreviation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevity_law) and it makes communication more efficient.

So naturally it hurts me when "Teixcalaan", one of the most commonly used words in the book, is such a long word. It's pronounced ["teyks-kah-lan"](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/243657/pronunciation-of-teixcalaan) which I had to Google to confirm I was pronouning it correctly, and it comes in at 3 sylables long.

I'm not too annoyed by this alone, but if something is from Teixcalaan, it's Teixcalaanli, and people from Teixcalaan are Teixalaanlitzlim. That's a five sylable demonym! If you can think up a real world demonym with five sylables, I'll be incredibly impressed, because there are almost none! And for a good reason! People often want to refer to themselves and thus the words used to do are often short. Surely if someone is from Teixcalaan, they're "Teix". I'm surprised the author didn't abbreviate it herself just to make life easier!

Since the Teixcalaan language is often described as a using "glyphs" I assume it's a logographic system like Chinese or something. I wonder if it would almost increase readability to just replace Teixcalaan with a 京[^1] or something in the book. Explain how to pronounce it once, and then just use the glyph. Teach the reader Teixcalaanli while reading. Creating a new font for Teixcalaanli glyphs would probably give the typographers of the print edition an anurism though.

### Colour

The author has a wonderful writing style that I enjoy reading. She paints the city of Teixcalaan so colourfully from the moment Mahit decends into the city. In comparison to the previous book I read - [Project Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary), which takes place predominately in a spaceship I imagine to be entirely white - the book just felt 'colourful'.

Pairing excellent descriptions with:

- some fun Teixcalaanli words
- custom character epitaphs
- the **awesome** "number-noun" naming scheme for all Teixcalaanlitzlim with floral, tool, and astral themes
- general floral themes of the city
- interesting poetry

made for conjuring up some _strong_ mental imagry while reading, which I really enjoyed.

### Internal Monologue

At some points in the novel, I felt like I had to read 1-2 pages of writing just to read a single to-and-fro comment from Mahit to a character. The author loves to interupt a sensance with some of Mahit's internal thoughts, which is fine most of the time, but sometimes the train of thought flits from talking, to internal thoughts, to comments on those internal thoughts, to a comment from Yskandr, to a response to Yskandr, and back to the initial conversion. Sometimes I just want to yell "JUST WRITE THE CONVERSATION AND EXPLAIN IT AFTER".

Overall, she did a fantastic job of making a book readable though, when the character has not only her own thoughts, but the thoughts of two Yskandr's to manage simaltaneously without filling the book with anime-style monologuing.

### Parallels to Dune

The writing style of this book "feels" similar to Dune on some hard-to-explain level. I think it's a strong reliance on language, poetry, and general aesthetics to describe an empire/culture, overlaid on a story heavy with political maneuvering that triggers these feelings.

Also, like in Dune, the author conjurs up strong mental imagry without necessarily _explicitly_ describing things, which probably results in readers imagining similar scenes quite differently from one another.

I will say I enjoyed this story far more than Dune though.

## Other

- If this book got a movie adaptation, the flower budget would be ludicrous.
- Surely we can find a synonym for "endocrine"? I just ctrl+f'd through the book, and "endocrine" was found 17 times. "Hormone" was only found 3 times. I just felt like I was reading the word "endocrine" a lot.
- When Yskandr 2.0 gets installed, and leafs through Mahit's memories, there is no mention of his liason 15 Engine being exploded next to Mahit.
- On Teixcalaan, when people get married, do they change their names? If so, do they take the number of the noun part?
- The Emperor sacrificing himself at the end was an _intense_ ending. Absolutely loved it.

[1^]: 京 means capital. Which is why 北京 (Beijing) and 東京 (Tokyo) both have it. It's often mentioned that Teixcalaan is one glyph. Notice that the symbol is ONE sylable in both these words, yet Teixcalaan in 3.
