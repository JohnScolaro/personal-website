In 2014 I spent 12 hours in South Korea while I waiting for a connecting flight to Canada. In 2025, I returned to actually walk around a little bit. I spent 4 full days in Seoul, and enjoyed each one of them. As an Australian, and coming from 3 weeks in Japan, whenever I saw something new, niche, or interesting, I wrote it down. Here an expanded version of that list.

## Cheap subway

Japan's subway is incredible. Seouls is also top tier, and in one aspect, it even beat's Japanese trains. It's significantly cheaper.

Thanks to Brisbane's recent 50c fairs, our trains are incredibly cheap. Unfortunately they're also not really that good. Japanese trains are absolutely incredible, but can cost up to ~$3-4 for regular trips, and up to $8 if you're going somewhere a little exotic. In a city that pays on average significantly less than Brisbane, this is pretty rough.

Seoul has Japan tier trains, but Brisbane level pricing.

## Let people leave the train before entering?

Something I don't like to see: Why doesn't the public wait to let people off the train before getting on? Coming from Japan where everyone queues up perfectly next to the door, I was surprised when people just waited right in front of the door blocking it. People obviously have to get off before you can fit in.

## Why is their card processing SO fast?

In Japan we mostly paid with cash. In Korea, we mostly paid with card. In Brisbane, when you pay with card the process is like this:

1. Tap Card
2. Wait 3 seconds awkwardly. Maybe say something like: "haha I hope this works" if you're feeling fancy.
3. Machine goes ding.

In Korea it felt like:

1. Tap Card
2. Machine instantly dings.

I would love to know if this is all in my head, or if there is some sort of technical reason why it's so much faster.

## Bowls insulated on the outside!!!

The first meal I had in Korea was a piping hot bowl of soup. As the lady passed it to me in a metal bowl, I was hesitant to take it, for fear of burning my soft hands. When I eventually did take it, it wasn't hot at all! It was a _double-walled insulated bowl_. I didn't know these even existed! I don't know if this is a classic ü•∂cold‚ùÑÔ∏è country thing that I just haven't experienced because I live in a ü•µhotüî• place.

It was very satisfying to slurp hot noodles in freezing weather, outdoors, and have the soup stay hot.

## The dining experience in Seoul feels optimised for groups. 

## Waste Disposal

management is terrible.

## Car Centricity

Huge roads. Very long waits at traffic lights. Who has ride-of-way at crosswalks?

## Aegyo Sal

## No kids? There just aren't any kids.

## Hangul is Awesome

## Identical Towers are not a vibe

## What the heck is Toowoomba Chicken
