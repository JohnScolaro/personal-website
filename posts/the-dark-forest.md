When contemplating whether or not I should read [The Three-Body Problem](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)>), I ran into a bunch of reviews online that said: "Yeah, it's good and all, but it really just sets up for the second and third books". So when I finished the first book and wrote my [silly review](http://johnscolaro.xyz/blog/the-three-body-problem), I started immediately on the second to see where the story went.

Well, obviously it was excellent. The way Liu Cixin puzzles together a multi-threaded story in a hypothetical future world with such detail and imagination is very impressive. He loves a twist, and the high stakes of "survival of all humanity" really draw you in. Like my last review though, I could write thousands of words of praise for the author, but who cares for that because everyone already loves the book, and endless praise has already been writen. Here are some points that don't make sense to me, or I found funny.

## The Chain of Believability

In these sci-fi books, authors layer a series of assertions together like a delicious lasagna. First _A_ happens and then people feel a certain way, and so then they do B, and then that changes things, so C seems like a rational decision, etc... Each step is a link in a chain, and the whole chain is the story. The total (verisimilitude)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude] (believability) of the story, for me, is the strength of the weakest link in the chain. Some of the following links in the chain that is [The Dark Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest) had me a little confused:

### Nobody figuring out the "spell" or thinking it's important

The book starts in the 21st century. Our good mate Luo Ji farts about for almost a decade doing essentially nothing after being selected as a Wallfacer. Suddenly he's like: "Oh shit, can I please send a message into space and then go to sleep for a really really long time?" I'm pretty sure Mr Luo talks his plan through with other people before blasting out a message to the universe saying "This planet over here is sus". He tells the special wallfacer council that he cast a "spell" and refuses to elaborate.

![Dr Evil from Austin Powers doing air quotes with the word "spell" above him.](/images/blog/the-dark-forest/spell.jpg)

The only reason to send communications is _for someone to recieve them_ and show they exist. I refuse to believe his message wasn't screened/understood by other humans, and the man's a rockstar, so humanity must know that if anything happens to the specific planet that Luo mentioned, there are some big bad aliens out there. Even Trisolaris thinks this is important because right after sending it, they send _additional ships_ to earth. Monitering this planet is _very_ important! Which makes it so jaw droppingly bizare that 200 years later after his beauty sleep, Luo is like: "Oh hey guys, did anything happen to that planet?" and the government is like

> Oh turns out it got fucking obliterated by aliens like a year ago but we forgot to look, and didn't think it would be important until now.

Excuse me, what?

### Humanity becoming drunk on confidence

200 years in the future, humanity has mastered nuclear fusion and so has essentially unlimited energy. They're beaming it around wirelessly for fun to power their cities. Thy cup of energy overfloweth. Humanity also has a huge space fleet, and the three competing superpowers all exist in space. No progress in physics is made however due to the sophon lock.

In the 21st century the state of affairs is as follows:

|                                   | Humanity | Trisolarans |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Knowledge of Gamebreaking Physics | ❌       | ✅          |
| Space Fleet                       | ❌       | ✅          |

In the 23rd century the state of affairs is as follows:

|                                   | Humanity | Trisolarans |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Knowledge of Gamebreaking Physics | ❌       | ✅          |
| Space Fleet                       | ✅       | ✅          |

And humanity is collectively rejoicing, wallowing in an ocean of self-congratulations. The fight will be over before it even begins, they don't stand a chance.

Is there really not a doubt in **anyones** mind that possibly the trisolarans could do something, perhaps unexpected, with their well-known mastery of physics? They have 12-dimensional supercomputers zooming around earth at the speed of light, instantly transmitting information about earth back to trisolaris at all times. Is it truly impossible to concieve of a situation where they can maybe beat the earth fleet?

This was one seriously weak link, that led immediately to another. This terminally positive attitude then leads to the earth disbanding the wallfacer project while many of the wallfacers are asleep, leaving Luo to wake up in a normal hospital where no less than 7 attempts on his life are immediately made. It's unbeliable that a government that spent millions keeping this man alive, suddenly doesn't care if he dies, despite him still being arguable the best weapon against Trisolaris that humans have.

### SEND THE WHOLE FLEET

One tiny intercepter shows up in the galaxy and the army is like: "Yo, let's get every space ship we have, and SEND THEM ALL to intercept. EVERY SHIP."

There is literally no reason to send like 2-per country. This would never happen, ever. Period. And the huge ensuing space-fight, arguably the most intense part of the book would have played out quite differently if the droplet hadn't been able to take out every ship earth had in about an hour.

### The Trisolarians not figuring out Luo Ji's Plan

## Why are all these men so thirsty?

"Her eyes were full of sunshine and vitality, and Zhang immediately trusted her, because the imprinted would never wear such an expression." And then proceeds to explain how to caption the ship constantly dropping "hypothetically if I was evil" every minute.

### Who keeps letting in these Wallbreakers

The Wallfacer/Wallbreaker interaction doesn't really contribute the

## Some Quotes I Thought Were Excellent

> What comrade Zhang Beihai says is parculiar", a colonel said. "is steadfast faith not built upon science and reason? No faith is solid that is not founded on objective fact?

Sir... have you heard of religion?

And when a scientist asked if he should explain something he thought a wallfacer already knew:

> You're permitted to be redundant

I'm stealing this.

Total acceptance that earth will win the war is 100% unfounded. Everyone is losing their mind for no reason, and the available information about the trisolaris fleet is the same as when it set out. Is it truly inconceivable that an alien force that made the sophons is more advanced than you

Also why did it even attack earlier anyway? Why not let humanity stew in a soup of self congratulations before destroying them. Why destroy them early and let them rebuild?
