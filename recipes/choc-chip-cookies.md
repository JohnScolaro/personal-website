## Optional Story

What's that? You _also_ have a recipe for choc-chip cookies? Whoop-dee-doo, so does everyone. This is mine.

What makes this recipe so special? Well, it's what my siblings and I used to make with my Mum when we were kids. It's incredibly easy, and when I was a child there was nothing better than walking into the kitchen with a bunch of these bad boys cooling on the countertop. I even have a picture of the OG recipe page that Mum made and printed out on our PC to put into a homemade recipe book.
