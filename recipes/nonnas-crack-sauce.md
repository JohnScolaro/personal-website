## Optional Story

When I was younger I remember driving around with my dad running chores. We made a quick stop at my Nonna and Nonno's place at around lunch time to either pick something up, drop something off, or maybe just say hello. I remember Nonna exclaiming that we must come in and eat, she was just cooking something. ~10 minutes later I'm eating this pasta and it's one of the best pasta pasta dishes I've ever had. I remember being confused because I swear she'd started and finished it in around 10 minutes so I quizzed her about it and she explained the recipe was roughly what I've written above. While I can't remember the exact ratio of butter to tomatos that she used, I remember being slightly revolted at the sheer quantity of butter I realised I'd consumed once she showed how to make it.

Extra tips/tricks:

- This recipe makes enough for probably 2~3 people.
- The ratio of butter to tomato is fast and loose, feel free to change it.
- The idea of the pepper, rosemary, and oregano isn't to significantly flavour the dish like a normal pasta sauce. Its purpose is more to give the appearance that you actually tried and fool the eater that this is a substantial meal.
- This recipe tastes a lot better if you _don't_ know how much butter is in it. If you want your guests to appreciate it, don't tell them. By reading this you've ruined it for yourself already (sorry).
- Sometimes when guests come over and I already have regular pasta sauce (prepped days beforehand), I whip this up in 5 minutes so guests can have a bit of both sauces. This feels fancy, and fools them into thinking I'm prepared, planned for dinner, and am a good cook.
