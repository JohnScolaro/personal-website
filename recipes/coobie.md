# Coobie

## Ingredient List

- 2kg lean beef
- 1kg cracked wheat
- 3 onions
- 3 cloves garlic
- 8 or 9 birds eye chillis
- 2 tsp salt
- A medium dish of mint - the more the better

## Method

1. Add water to cracked wheat to just cover surface and allow to absorb - 20 minutes or so.
2. Slice meat and onions then add all ingredients and mid together in a large container.
3. Blend and mix mixture two times through the mincer.

- To cook in frypan, form rissoles and cook in olive oil for six minutes on each side on medium heat.
- To bake, put in dish with a drizzle of olive oil, 35-45 minutes at 190 degrees C.

## Extra Information

The above method is exactly how Grandad had written it on a piece of paper he sent me. It feels rude to change it, but it's potentially missing some details if you've never made it before:

- It says lean beef, but you can substitute mince instead. I've even made it with the cheaper fattier beef, and it still tasted excellent.
- Cracked wheat is normally bought as [Bulgur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgur). When you purchase it, there are a various levels of coarseness, and coarse or fine might be the right option depending on the brand. You're looking for chunks just under 1mm<sup>3</sup> so that when they absorb the water, they're about 1mm<sup>3</sup>.

## Optional Story

I'm a measly 1/8th Lebanese. My Grandad is 1/2 Lebanese, and this recipe has been transfered to us through him. We think that Coobie (that's how we pronouce it) is a version of [Kibbeh](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dM11KvvDRnJXgwUr9) or كبة, that has slowly morphed over the years to become an entirely different dish for our family. I think 50% of the meals I've had with my Grandparents have involved coobie. Grandad has a big steel mincer we used to clamp to a wooden table outside. When I was a little kid, I'd watch him mince the meat, and as I got older, I'd be assigned mincing duty. We'd pick the mint from two giant pots that sat outside. I remember once I had to back the mincer up because I spotted a big caterpillar under a leaf I'd just stuffed into it. Grandad said something along the lines of: "Just a bit of extra protein". I wonder how many caterpillar's I've eaten over the years...

Also, I don't know how you're _supposed_ to eat Kibbeh, but it's not sacrilegious to drown our coobie in tomato sauce.
