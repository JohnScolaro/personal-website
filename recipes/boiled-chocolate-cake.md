# Boiled Chocolate Cake

## Ingredient List

- 2 cups sugar
- 225g butter (8 oz)
- 1 level tsp bicarb soda
- 4 tbsp cocoa
- 1 tablespoon drinking chocolate
- 3 cups self raising flour
- 3 eggs

## Method

1. Add sugar, water, butter, bi-carb soda, cocoa, drinking choc to pot.
2. Simmer gently for 5 mins, then cool for about 1 hour.
3. Add self raising flour and 3 beaten eggs.
4. Whisk to remove any lumps.
5. Line large tin with alfoil.
6. Bake in 180 degree oven for 1 hour.

## Icing Method 1 - Cream + Choc

My favourite icing method is to cut the cake into a top and bottom layer. Make some whipped cream. Create a layer of whipped cream between the layers of the cake, and then cover the outside of the cake with whipped cream. Grate a block of chocolate, and cover the cream with chocolate.

## Icing Method 2 - Choc Frosting

Add 3 teaspoons of melted butter, 1 tablespoon of cocoa, and 1 cup of icing sugar. Add hot water a little bit at a time until you get the consistency you need. Ice the cake.

## Optional Story

This is my Mum's classic boiled chocolate cake. It's the most popular cake for all family celebrations throughout my entire childhood. It's delicious, and fairly easy! I remember when I was in grade 11 in highschool, I was applying to be school captain in year 12. I asked Mum if she could make me one of these cakes if I won school captain. I instead got school _vice_-captain and Mum made me a mini-cake with a bunch of cream that I devoured in one sitting.

Here is the old recipe as it existed in the old family cookbook:
