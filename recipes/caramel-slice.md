# Caramel Slice

## Ingredient List

- 1 cup self raising flour
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup dessicated coconut
- 150g butter
- 400g condensed milk
- 2 tablespoons of golden syrup
- 20g copha
- 150g cooking chocolate

## Method

1. To create the base, combine 1 cup self raising flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup coconut and 125g softened/melted butter. Mix well, and mould to bottom of tin.
2. Oven at 180 for 10 minutes.
3. To create the caramel, combine 400g condensed milk, 1 tbs butter, 2 tbs golden syrup in a pot.
4. Stir constantly over heat until mixture has boiled for ~5 minutes. Use the colour to judge when it's done. No real easy way to know when it's perfect without making this recipe a few times.
5. Spread over base. Oven for 10 mins. Allow to cool.
6. To create topping, melt chocolate and copha together. Spread over caramel.
7. Immediately store in the fridge to cool the chocolate.

## Tips and Tricks

- When cutting the slice up, boil some water, and periodically dip the knife in the boiling water. You want the knife to melt through the chocolate layer. This will keep the slices clean and neat, otherwise the brittle chocolate will crack unevenly while cutting it over the softer caramel.

## Optional Story

This is a copy of the typewritten recipe my Dad used to make his caramel slice. He made this a lot growing up, and is one of two variations. This is a plain chocolate and caramel one, but a white-choc macadamia version exists as well. I have fond memories of Dad taking the slice out of the tin once it has cooled, and 'squaring up' the sides of the slice so that each individual slice was perfectly shaped. This is great, because we'd has a bunch of offcuts which we would immediately eat. Here is a picture of the original recipe from the recipe book:
